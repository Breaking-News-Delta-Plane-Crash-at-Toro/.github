In a shocking turn of events, a Delta Airlines flight experienced a catastrophic incident upon landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport  today. The **delta plane crash toronto** has sent ripples across the aviation industry, raising questions about aviation safety.  

## Incident Overview  

The aircraft involved in the crash was a CRJ-900 regional jet operating under Delta Connection, flown by Endeavor Air.

According to preliminary reports, the **delta plane flipped upside down** after an apparent loss of control during touchdown.

### Weather Conditions: A Contributing Factor?  

Authorities are investigating whether adverse weather played a role in the **delta plane crash toronto**. Reports indicate heavy rainfall and strong crosswinds were present at the time of the incident.

Meteorologists suggest that wind shear—a sudden change in wind speed or direction—could have caused the **delta plane overturns while landing at toronto airport**. This phenomenon is notorious for creating hazardous situations for pilots attempting to stabilize their aircraft during approach.  

## Eyewitness Accounts  

Passengers aboard the flight described chaotic moments as the **delta flight crash today** unfolded. "It felt like we were sliding uncontrollably," one passenger recounted. "Then there was a loud bang, and everything went dark."

## Investigation Underway

### Historical Context
